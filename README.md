# NotVeryCleanCode
This is a repository created for Technologies Of Software Development course, 
it is a starting point for the "Clean Code" topic exercises. 
Wouter Lagerweij is an author of the ConfirmationLetterGenerator class, 
and his tutorial will be used for the exercises.

In the repository you have an example of some not very clean code. 
Most of the classes is there only to support some IDE completion for your convenience,
and won't actually work.

It's a maven based project, so you can open it in any java IDE. It already comes with Junit dependency, 
so you can use it for your test in place of "TestCase" class examples from the tutorial.
